# Oura-Ring-Project
Trained a LightGBM classifier to predict next-day stress levels using personal Oura Ring data, including REM sleep, heart rate variability, body temperature deviation, and prior-day activity. Applied time-series cross-validation and SHAP explainability to understand key drivers of stress prediction.
